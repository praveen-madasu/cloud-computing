    "##### TF-IDF\n",
    "\n",
    "- The tf–idf is the product of two statistics, term frequency and inverse document frequency. There are various ways for determining the exact values of both statistics.\n",
    "- Term frequency tf(t,d), the simplest choice is to use the raw count of a term in a document, i.e., the number of times that term t occurs in document d.\n",
    "- The inverse document frequency is a measure of how much information the word provides, i.e., if it's common or rare across all documents. It is the logarithmically scaled inverse fraction of the documents that contain the word (obtained by dividing the total number of documents by the number of documents containing the term, and then taking the logarithm of that quotient)\n",

    "##### Cosine Similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them. \n",
    "- The cosine of 0° is 1, and it is less than 1 for any angle in the interval (0,π] radians. It is thus a judgment of orientation and not magnitude: two vectors with the same orientation have a cosine similarity of 1, two vectors oriented at 90° relative to each other have a similarity of 0, and two vectors diametrically opposed have a similarity of -1, independent of their magnitude. \n",

    "- After data Preprocessing, we stuck with just two columns plot and genre. So, now our aim was to convert all movies plots into vector and then train the model.\n",
    "- As you can see in the figure first few steps were for feature extraction. In which we did punctuation removal which will remove all comma, semi-colon, question-mark etc. It will be followed by removing stop words like is, are, was etc. \n",
    "- Then we did tokenization and vectorization to convert plot into vector of words and which helped us to calculate tf-idf vector. The output was very sparse with 70K features.\n",
    "- As we want to solve multiclass classification problem, we tried to train our data using Naïve Bayes and Logistic Regression. Which are both likelihood-probabilistic model which can give class probabilities about that genre to be a particular class and we can pick the best.\n",

We got timed-out error many times then instead of parsing that sparse matrix, we converted matrix in dense manner. Which has tuple with three values. First one is total feature, second is list of indexes of non-zero tf-idf score words and last value of score. \n",
